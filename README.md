# Wikipedia NPOV Corpus
This repository holds a corpus of Wikipedia revisions tagged as NPOV (Neutral Point of View)
The intended purpose of this repository is to replicate the corpus discussed in [Linguistic Models for Analyzing and Detecting Biased Language,  Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil, et al. ]( https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/pubs/neutrality.pdf) as well as create a useful API for continually adding to the corpus for further training needs. Anyone may use this repository for their desired products as long as credit is given to Danescu-Niculescu Mizil, et al.
